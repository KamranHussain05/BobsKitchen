# Bob's Kitchen

Beta Release, 5/3/21
Version 0.0.3
No Dependencies

Program Purpose:
Bob’s Kitchen is a game where players strive to make the best dish they can! The
game is coded in Java with a clean and easy to use
Target User Profile:
This game is intended for high school students who are interested in cooking and
food.

Feature List:
● A clean and easy to use home page with a help window.
● Confirmations before playing each level/dish
● Clearly labeled options for user choices and inputs
● User options are simple and easy to select
● Submit page provides a summary of the user selected options

Class List: Main, Home, ConfirmSandwichPlay, SandwichStart, SandwichMeat,
Sandwich condiments, SandwichFinish.

Team Responsibility:
Kevin Choi - Made all the images needed to run the program. Made a label for
each image (if needed) and found images appropriate for the program to run
smoothly. Research color and themes for the program.

Kamran Hussain - Implemented features in the program, specifically the graphics
in the sandwich level. Took the sketches from Will and put them into coded classes
primarily graphics. Began work on developing the game engine with Kevin and
Will, starting to implement the sandwich scoring system when the user inputs are
completed.

William Le: Listed Fields, Methods, and Constructors in each class via comments.
Drew out by hand and made a UML Diagram for the program including arrows
that show hierarchy and class paths. I came up with the idea of a cooking game
including the game engine (how the game works), the various dishes that we will
soon have, and I drew out some sketches on what the game should look like.

Known Bugs/Workarounds:
-User selected fields do not deactivate when the page is reloaded
-Drop menu images do not update images
-Sandwich Condiments window is not formatted correctly
-Formatting in the finish window right jpanel is not functioning properly,
formatting is all on one line, GridLayout may be implemented
-Images on the meats page are too wide for the vertical boxes on the JButtons

Key Learnings:
-Learned how to implement graphics spanning multiple types of input fields across
multiple fields.
-Learned how to use Github for fast file transfers and collaboration
-Learned how to create images based off written request

Credit List: Image sources (Kevin), Programming(Kamram), UML Diagram(Will)
Referenced the uml diagram from the final project, and applied what we learned
about class hierarchies and “depends on” relationships between the class to draw
out the class paths.
